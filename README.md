# SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry: Metadata editor

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

# Introduction
The FAIR Vocabulary Registry for the Humanities and Social Science (SSH) is built in the context of the "Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud" project ([SSHOC.nl](https://sshoc.nl/)). This project develops state-of-the-art infrastructure for social science and humanities research in collaboration between [ODISSEI](https://odissei-data.nl/) (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations) and [CLARIAH](https://www.clariah.nl/) (Common Lab Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities).

The SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry is a one-stop reference service for vocabularies that are relevant to researchers, developers, data managers or curators in the humanities and social sciences resesarch communities. It aims to support them in finding, (re)using, publishing and adding vocabularies to the registry.

You are here in one of the repositories that form part of the registry architecture. This repository contains the code for the Metadata editor. This editor is built using the [CLARIN Component Metadata infrastructure (CMDI)](https://www.clarin.eu/content/cmdi-component-metadata-infrastructure), which facilitates the modelling, authoring and use of the vocabularies´ metadata.

Each vocabulary in the SSH FAIR Vocabulary Registry is described according to a metadata schema (current work in progress available here).
